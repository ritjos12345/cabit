GoTaxi™ – Description
Taxis are widely used around the world as one of the major public transport provider.

The taxi driver – costumer relation was always under the supervision of the taxis dispatcher
and therefore restricted to its rules, causing economic inefficiency due to fees overhead
paid by drivers to their dispatchers – reflecting the costumers' price.

Our goal is to overcome these extra payments by giving every potential driver the ability to
offer his service directly to costumers based on his and their location.

Both sides need only Smartphone with our GoTaxi™ app installed (drivers will use their
edition) in order to communicate and set the necessary details for the ride.
